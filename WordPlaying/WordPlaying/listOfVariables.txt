A  Switching on and off, initial states	18
--------------------------------------------
xFB_VehicleContrOn - By switching 32S01 to “0” position signal xFB_VehicleContrOn goes low. It gives the request for deactivation of control system.

xREL_VehicleContrOff - Deactivation of the control system is done by signal (xREL_VehicleContrOff) activation.

xCB_BattDistr - Monitoring of state of 24VDC battery net distribution circuit breaker 32F01 (xCB_BattDistr). CB tripped --> DDS 0606 ”32F01 – Jistič bateriové sítě – skříň 114”



Z    Drive operation, braking operation, traction preparation	21
--------------------------------------------------------------------
xFB_DirectA - For the direction Forward we use relay -22K11 RIOMS signal (xFB_DirectA) 
xFB_DirectB - For the direction Backward we use relay -22K12 RIOMS signal (xFB_DirectB)

xFB_DirLeverA - We directly monitor also Direction lever signals xFB_DirLeverA (relay  -22K10)
xFB_DirLeverB - We directly monitor also Direction lever signals xFB_DirLeverB (relay -22K20)

xFB_Direct_Neutral - Neutral direction is derived from the relay -22K13 RIOM signal (xFB_Direct_Neutral)
xFB_DriveMC -       
xFB_FullDriveMC -     
xFB_CoastingMC -   
xFB_InvMSB_MC -    
xFB_InvBrMC -     
xFB_InvEmBrMC - Digital signal xFB_DriveMC, xFB_FullDriveMC, xFB_CoastingMC, xFB_InvMSB_MC, xFB_InvBrMC, xFB_InvEmBrMC signals are received over RIOMs and send via CAN. TCMS has to consider different timing of the digital feedback of master controller.

wVAL_MasterContrHd - Master Controller analogue value

xFB_Hd_MC_DR2 - (default 80% of max effort),
xFB_Hd_MC_DR1 - (default 40% of max effort),
xFB_Hd_MC_BR0 - Coasting
xFB_Hd_MC_BR1 - (default 50% of max braking effort)
xFB_Hd_MC_BR2 - Inv (100% of max braking effort)  

xPB_RearConReq - Activation Rear Console by the switch -22SZS +111A signal (xPB_RearConReq) 
xREL_RearConIndi1 - Indication on correct activation of Rear Console is by LED inside  22SZS +111A controlled by relay -22KZS +183A and DO xREL_RearConIndi1  

xPB_RearVigilance - At using any driving and braking command driver must press Vigilance Push Button signal (xPB_RearVigilance)
xREL_DriveRC - For the driving and braking from Rear Console are implemented RIOM DO(xREL_DriveRC)(xREL_InvBrMC) enabling sending required information to converters (TCU) and brake control unit (BCU)
xREL_InvBrMC - For the driving and braking from Rear Console are implemented RIOM DO(xREL_DriveRC)(xREL_InvBrMC) enabling sending required information to converters (TCU) and brake control unit (BCU)

xPB_WashMachine - Washing mode is selected by -22SWM +111E generating signal (xPB_WashMachine) functionality is controlled by VCU
xPB_EmDrive_NoBc - This mode is selected by -22SNJ +111A signal (xPB_EmDrive_NoBc)

DI_Emergency_Drive The BCU with wire signal DegradedMode
DI_Drive (default 40% of max effort), 
DI_FullDrive (default 80% of max effort), 
DI_Brake_Inv (default 50% of max braking effort) and 
DI_FullBrake_Inv (100% of max braking effort) control the applied effort while the braking inputs have priority.

 usStep1CycleCounter -  Tomik Counter

If a CANopen failure is detected, the effort reference will be set to zero for acceleration.
If braking is selected - indicated by the digital inputs 
DI_Brake_Inv, 
DI_FullBrake_Inv or 
DI_HazardBrake_Inv the behavior will be like in emergency mode

TCU_bDC_Trip
DO_EDBrakeOK 

xREL_MSB_Act - TCMS has to apply MSB xREL_MSB_Act through -22K09 +183A
VCU_bBrakeBlending When crossing the speed threshold (default 3km/h, final value will be established during commissioning) in braking mode the VCU sets the signal VCU_bBrakeBlending (in some other applications called also Stopping Brake signal)
Two directions can be defined using bits DI_Forward and DI_Backward
VCU can initiate the wheel calibration by setting “VCU_bEnaWheelCalib=1”
If the motor temperature exceeds 140°C a Warning is set and above 145°C the TCU goes into trip status indicated by the signal TCU_bDC_Trip. 

xREL_MSB_Act - TCMS has to apply MSB xREL_MSB_Act through -22K09 +183A
VCU_bTripReset - VCU_bTripReset=1 (It is a global reset for all active faults.)


xHwPortSetCfgNOK    -    ST_SethwPortPar failed 

   xHwPortSetCfgNOK  - xxxxx

The adhesion control also defines when the Slip/Slide bits will be set (TCU_bLowSlipSlide (default >5% reduction, >500ms) and TCU_bDeepSlide (default >20% reduction, >1,5s)).
